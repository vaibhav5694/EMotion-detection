# EMotion-detection


"I implemented emotion detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. The model, developed with the Keras library, was trained on the fer2013 dataset, which contains facial expressions annotated with emotions. To make the model accessible to users, I created a user-friendly web interface using Flask for file uploading and emotion prediction. The web application includes HTML and CSS components for a visually appealing experience.

For deployment, I chose Netlify to host the web application. The integration of Flask with the front-end allows users to upload an image, and the CNN model predicts the emotion associated with the facial expression based on the learning from the fer2013 dataset. This project leverages Python's machine learning capabilities for emotion analysis, Flask for web development, and Netlify for seamless deployment."
